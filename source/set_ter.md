The bash prompt (stefano@linux:~$) is only the first of a couple of prompts you might see,:

PS1: The default promt you see when you open a shell

It's value is stored in an environment variable called PS1. To see its value, type

echo $PS1

This will give you something like

\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$
To change it, you can set a new value for the variable:

export PS1="\u > "
This will result in a prompt like this:

stefano > 
PS2: is your secondary prompt. This get's shown when a command is not finished. Type echo "asd and hit enter, the secondary prompt will let you enter more lines until you close the inverted commas.

PS3 is the prompt used for select(2)

PS4 is the prompt used for alt text stack traces (default: +)

To make the changes permanent, you append them to the end of .bash_profile (or .bashrc, see this question) in your home directory.

Here's a more or less complete list of shorthand that you can use when composing these:

\a     The 'bell' charakter
\A     24h Time
\d     Date (e.g. Tue Dec 21)
\e     The 'escape' charakter
\h     Hostname (up to the first ".")
\H     Hostname
\j     No. of jobs currently running (ps)
\l     Current tty
\n     Line feed
\t     Time (hh:mm:ss)
\T     Time (hh:mm:ss, 12h format)
\r     Carriage return
\s     Shell (i.e. bash, zsh, ksh..)
\u     Username
\v     Bash version
\V     Full Bash release string
\w     Current working directory
\W     Last part of the current working directory
\!     Current index in history
\#     Command index
\$     A "#" if you're root, else "$"
\\     Literal Backslash
\@     Time (12h format with am/pm)
You can of course insert any literal string, and any command:

export PS1="\u \$(pwd) > "
Where $(pwd) stands in place of "the output of" pwd.

If the command substitution is escaped, as in \$(pwd), it's evaluated every time the prompt is displayed, otherwise, as in $(pwd), it's only evaluated once when bash is started.
If you want your prompt to feature colours, you can use bash's colour codes to do it. The code consists of three parts:

40;33;01
The first part before the semicolon represents the text style.

00=none
01=bold
04=underscore
05=blink
07=reverse
08=concealed
The second and third part are the colour and the background color:

30=black
31=red
32=green
33=yellow
34=blue
35=magenta
36=cyan
37=white
Each part can be omitted, assuming starting on the left. i.e. "1" means bold, "1;31" means bold and red. And you would get your terminal to print in colour by escaping the instruction with \33[ and ending it with an m. 33, or 1B in hexadecimal, is the ascii sign "ESCAPE" (a special character in the ascii character set). Example:

"\33[1;31mHello World\33[m"
Prints "Hello World" in bright red.
